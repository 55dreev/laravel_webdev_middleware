                            VALORANT is a free-to-play first-person tactical shooter video game being developed and published by Riot Games.
                            It was announced on October 15, 2019 under the codename "Project A", until it was officially revealed as VALORANT on March 2, 2020. It was officially released on June 2nd, 2020 for PC.
                            By the time VALORANT reached its first anniversary, the game had 14 million active monthly players and Riot announced the game would soon be coming to mobile platforms, with console platforms also being explored but not as high a priority. 
                            Of the two platforms however, it was console that arrived first with a limited beta starting on June 14, 2024.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            VALORANT takes place on a version of Earth in the near future following an event known as First Light. This event spans the entire globe, leading to big transformations to life, technology, and how governments operate. 
                            However, select people across the globe start to gain abilities stemming from this massive event. These gifted individuals are called Radiants.
                            In response to First Light, a shadow organization founds the VALORANT Protocol, which pulls together agents from all over the world. These Agents consist of Radiants and other individuals equipped with Radiant technology. 
                            Due to the backstories of these characters, the VALORANT team features interesting dynamics as the individuals not only sometimes know each other, but they also come from a wide spectrum of backgrounds ranging from crime to the military.

                            Resident Evil 4 is a 2005 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom for the GameCube. 
                            Players control the special agent Leon S. Kennedy on a mission to rescue the US president's daughter, Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a religious cult in rural Spain. 
                            Leon fights hordes of enemies infected by a mind-controlling parasite and reunites with the spy Ada Wong. 
                            In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower gameplay of previous Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 4 features a dynamic camera system and action-oriented gameplay.
